<h1> this is the index page </h1>
<p> For some reason, this was originally a default for github pages so I just
scrapped it and wrote this from scratch. I think trying to publish it messed
with some other files too, which is why there isn't an src, and the css has
been replaced with a "github stylesheets" folder.
